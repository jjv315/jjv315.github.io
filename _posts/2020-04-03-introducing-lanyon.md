title: Traveling Salesperson Problem
---



### What are we looking for?

We are attempting to come up with a solution to find the shortest path we can possibly take with 4 different locations.  For this example, we will use NFL stadiums.  The stadiums we will be using is Lambeau Field (Green Bay), AT&T Stadium (Dallas), Allegiant Stadium (Las Vegas), and Lumen Field (Seattle).  I will present to you 3 different maps and how far the salesperson would have to travel for each different scenario.

### Map 1

To start off, the first map I will show you is the easiest and most efficient way the salesperson can travel. Below, you can see the distance traveled (in miles) to each stadium.  In addition, you can see on the map the specific route the salesperson has taken.  In this example, the salesperson is traveling from Lambeau Field to AT&T Stadium to Allegiant Stadium to Lumen Field, then back to the original spot, Lambeau.  The total distance taken for this route is 5,393 miles.

### Map 2

This map shows the 2nd optioned route the salesperson should take if something were to go wrong where they could not travel using the first map's route.  In the example below, the salesperson is traveling from Allegiant Stadium to Lambeau Field to AT&T Stadium to Lumen, then back to Allegiant.  The total for this travel is 6,151 miles.

### Map 3

The 3rd, and last, map presents you the last case scenario the salesperson should take.  In this example, the salesperson travels from Lambeau Field to Allegiant Stadium to AT&T Stadium to Lumen, then back to Lambeau.  The total mileage to take this route accumulates to 7,040 miles.
